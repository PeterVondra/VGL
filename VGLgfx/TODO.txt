-Add deletion queue for vulkan handles.
-Make descriptor addImage(...) frameindex independent.
-Make a separate render thread, render thread will query for commands every frame, while Application thread will submit render commands to a render command queue.
The render thread will execute the commands from the render command queue.
-Use vk MultiView extension for omni-directional shadow mapping. DONE
-Add physically based bloom, use compute for downsampling and upsampling. DONE
1. Find specific queue that supports compute operations. DONE
2. Create compute pipeline and syncronization objects to sync between compute and graphics operations
3. Record commandbuffer with compute operations.
(Create simple abstraction for easy compute integration into existing renderpipeline, similar to framebuffer attachment class)
